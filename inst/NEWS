rfUtilities_1.0-1
=================

* Fixed bug, in functions requiring randomForest class object, where stop error is issued when 
    model is specified using formula interface.
	
* Added new function "rf.partial.ci" for Random Forests regression partial dependency plot with 
    confidence intervals.
	
* Added new function "rf.class.sensitivity" for sensitivity test of class to cross-assignment. 

rfUtilities_1.0-2
=================

* Fixed bug, in rf.modelSel where no model was returned when final=TRUE.

* Added new function  rf.imp.freq that prints/plots frequency of variable selection 
    across classes.

rfUtilities_2.0-0
=================

* Major restructuring of the package, adding object classes along with print, plot and  
    summary functions for classes.
	
* Added new function "accuracy" for a variety of classification accuracy statistics.  
    Function is also called from rf.crossValidation. 
	
* Added new function "occurrence.threshold" for testing the sensitivity of probability 
     thresholds.
	 
* Added new function "rf.effect.size" for calculating "parameter" effect size on  
    classification or regression models using the Cohen's f2 statistic. 
	
* Added new function "rf.regression.fit" providing fit statistics for random forests 
    regression models. 
	
* Rewrote and added class attribute to rf.significance function along with print, 
    summary and plot generics.
	
* Rewrote and added class attribute to rf.crossValidation function along with print, 
    summary and plot generics.
	
* Added users accuracy, producers accuracy and kappa to rf.crossValidation output.
